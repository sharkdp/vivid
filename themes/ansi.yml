# A theme that uses the terminal's 16-color ANSI palette
#
# By reusing the color palette that the user has configured, the ls colors will nicely
# blend in with their surroundings.
#
# This theme optimizes for the following goals and guidelines:
#
# 1. Prefer the 8 base (non-bright) color variants. This ensures that the theme works well
#    with minimal color themes which assign the same color for the base and bright
#    variant. Furthermore, distinguishing between shades of the same color takes more
#    effort and thus runs counter to quick transmission of information to the user.
# 2. No explicit use of black and white as these are usually the or similar to the default
#    foreground and background colors.
# 3. No background colors. Since we do not know the actual colors corresponding to the
#    ANSI color codes, background colors risk making the text difficult to read. However,
#    we assume that in any theme the colors except black can be reasonably well read on
#    the default background (light themes often switch black and white).
# 4. Prefer bold for highlighting over underlines as underlines hurt readability in my
#    opinion.
# 5. Similar files have similar styles, so sockets and pipes have the same color, for
#    example.
# 6. Regular files are neither colored nor have a font-style with two exceptions: READMEs
#    and similar are bold and unimportant files de-emphasized with faint style. This
#    avoids visual overload from coloring too many things.
